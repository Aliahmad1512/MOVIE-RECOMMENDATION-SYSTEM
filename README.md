## Content-Based-Recommender
Content-based filtering methods are based on a description of the item and a profile of the user's preferences. In this system, keywords are used to describe the items, and a user profile is built to indicate the type of item this user likes. In other words, these algorithms try to recommend items similar to those that a user liked in the past or is examining in the present.
